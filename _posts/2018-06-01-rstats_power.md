As the workshop series in R-statistics goes on, I have moved from latex with knitr to R-presentations and html R-notebooks.
The documents are less elegant, but faster to create and easier to display on-line!

So, here are my slides about power analysis using simulations in R: [http://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/PowerAndLM](http://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/PowerAndLM)

here is an exercise: [http://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/tempPA](http://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/tempPA)

The full material is on github:
