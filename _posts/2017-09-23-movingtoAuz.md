When I am not busy with science, work, social interaction, or life-maintaining activities, I spend most of my time outside, looking at wild organisms, trying to identity them, or observing their behavior. Let's be honest here, it is 90% about birds, the rest of my attention being split between reptiles, amphibians, dragonflies, butterflies, crickets, beetles, angiosperms, mammals and on occasion other [more significant clades](http://www.onezoom.org/life/@Euryarchaeota=635958?vis=spiral#x378,y409,w0.5319).
I started observing birds, collecting beetles and shells, and trying to identify wild flowers before I was ten years old. Over the course of years, I got good enough at bird identification to become member of local sighting validation committee (local only, so not that good). I also learned to name all the vertebrates (except for actinopterygians, 99% of what people call "fish"), all the orchids, most butterflies and dragonflies, and a fair share of flowering plants and crickets (orthoptera), encountered on the field. Finally, I would always have a vague idea (a common name, a family, or at least an order) of what were the other insects, the mushrooms, the spiders... That felt really great.
But that was all in Western Europe...

I have just moved to from Zurich, Switzerland, to Canberra, Australia, and currently plan to stay there for the next three years. All is new, I know nothing.
