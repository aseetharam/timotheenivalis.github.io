Time to start again the workshop series about statistics in R at the Research School of Biology (ANU, Canberra).

Workshops will be held fortnightly. We will cover the basics of R programming and statistical inference, models, plots (and ggplot!) and more.
There will be extra time for attendants to ask questions, present their problems and get help from everyone.

Drop me an [email](mailto:timotheebonnetc@gmail.com) if you would like to join.

Last year course material is on GitHub: [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles), feel free to share, re-use, fork, change.
