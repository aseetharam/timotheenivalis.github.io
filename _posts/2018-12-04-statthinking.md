Recently I had a lot of fun teaching a three-days course on statistical thinking in biology.
The course was developped based on material from Dr. Teresa Neeman, statistician at the Australian National University.

The course material is here: [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro).

PDF for the each chapter :
* [Bases of statistical thinking and modelling](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro/blob/master/Chapter1.pdf)
* [Experimental design](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro/blob/master/Chapter2.pdf)
* [The mean structure: additive and full-factorial models](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro/blob/master/Chapter3.pdf)
* [The variance structure: blocking with random effects](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro/blob/master/Chapter4.pdf)
* [Non-Gaussian responses: Generalized Linear Model for binary and count data](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Stat-Intro/blob/master/Chapter5.pdf)
