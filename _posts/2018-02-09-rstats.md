I am starting a series of workshop about statistics in R at the Research School of Biology (ANU, Canberra).
I upload course material on GitHub: [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/Rcode-Stats-Bubbles), feel free to share, re-use, fork, change.

Thanks a lot to Nina McLean and Kevin Murray for their help.
