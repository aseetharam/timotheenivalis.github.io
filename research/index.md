I am an evolutionary biologist primarily interested in recent genetic evolution and its interaction with the ecology and life-history of the organisms I see around me while hiking or birdwatching.

# Contemporary evolution: how it works and whether it matters  

Human activities changes the environment of many species, to the point where they can go extinct. Genetic adaptation is one thing that can allow them to persist, but
1) Does genetic adaptation to environmental changes happen on contemporary time scales in wild populations?
A subsidiary question more rarely asked, but the one we need to know whether populations persist of go extinct, is:
2) Does it matter for population dynamics?

Spoilers: Based on my PhD and postdoc work on a snow vole population, the answers are 1) absolutely, yes; and 2) probably yes, but it is very difficult to be sure.

# Recursive evolution: hybridization and speciation

I am also interested in the evolutionary consequences of hybridization, in particular how genetic introgression affects varies along genomes, and why.

# Biodiversity and human activities

Although it is currently not a research focus of mine, I find hard to imagine doing wildlife research without thinking about the effects of human activities on biodiversity (sadly mainly negative, but do not forget the good sides).

How do small field mammals deal with repeated disturbance associated with modern farming?
For more on this thematic, check out the work of [Bertrand Gauffre](http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/Fidentite/gauffre/GB_gauffre.htm), and the team [AgriPop](http://www.za.plainevalsevre.cnrs.fr/).

I did an internship on the conservation of birds in extensive Alpine meadows and contributed with a local branch of Birdlife France ( [LPO Isère](http://isere.lpo.fr/) ).
