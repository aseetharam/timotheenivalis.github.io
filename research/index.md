I am an evolutionary biologist primarily interested in recent genetic evolution and its interaction with the ecology and life-history of the organisms I see around me while hiking or birdwatching.

# Contemporary evolution: how it works and whether it matters  

I primarily study the causes and consequences of contemporary evolution in a natural population of a small rodent (snow voles), and how evolution contributes to population dynamics.

# Recursive evolution: hybridization and speciation

I am also interested in the evolutionary consequences of hybridization.

# Biodiversity and human activities

Although it is currently not a research focus of mine, I find hard to imagine doing wildlife research without thinking about the effects of human activities on biodiversity (sadly mainly negative, but do not forget the good sides) .

How do small field mammals deal with repeated disturbance associated with modern farming?
For more on this thematic, check out the work of [Bertrand Gauffre](http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/Fidentite/gauffre/GB_gauffre.htm), and the team [AgriPop](http://www.za.plainevalsevre.cnrs.fr/).

I did an internship on the conservation of birds in extensive Alpine meadows and contributed with a local branch of Birdlife France ( [LPO Is√®re](http://isere.lpo.fr/) ).
