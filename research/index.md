I am an evolutionary biologist primarily interested in recent genetic evolution and its interaction with the ecology and life-history of the organisms I see around me while hiking or birdwatching.

# Contemporary evolution in the wild: how it works and why it matters  

I primarily study the causes and consequences of contemporary evolution in a natural population of a small rodent (snow voles), and how evolution contributes to population dynamics.

# Introgressive hybridization, recursive evolution and speciation

I am also interested in the evolutionary consequences of hybridization.
