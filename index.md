I am an evolutionary biologist primarily interested in recent genetic evolution and its interaction with the ecology and life-history of the organisms I see around me while hiking or birdwatching. I am currently a post-doctorate at the [Research School of Biology](https://biology.anu.edu.au/) and also work part-time to provide support in statistics and programming within the new [Biological Data Science Institute](http://bdsi.anu.edu.au/); both part of the Australian National University in Canberra.

A complete CV hides [here](http://timotheenivalis.github.io/Rnotebooks/cv.pdf).
