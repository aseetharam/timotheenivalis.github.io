I am an evolutionary biologist primarily interested in recent genetic evolution and its interaction with the ecology and life-history of the organisms I see around me while hiking or birdwatching. I am currently a Lecturer at the Australian National University (Research School of Biology, Canberra).  

*Thanks for visiting my website. Here is how it is (dis-)organized:*
- [A brief overview of my research interests](/research/)
- [A list of publications](/publications/)
- [My current and past affiliations and collaborations](/dispersal/)
- [Some information on my non-so-academic interests](/outside/)
- [A blog in case I happen to be not so lazy](/posts/)
