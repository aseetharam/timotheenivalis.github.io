This website is still being constructed, but already contains some information.

I am an evolutionary biologist primarily interested in recent genetic evolution and its interaction with the ecology and life-history of the organisms I see around me while hiking or birdwatching.

* Links to code and publications
* Things...

This website is powered by Jekyll, hosted on GitHub and is based on the Minimal Mistakes Theme.
